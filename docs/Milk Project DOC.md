## 4. Detailed Workflows

### 4.1 Drive Creation Workflow

1. Admin selects a route.
2. Assigns a delivery guy.
3. Sets stock quantity.
4. Generates a delivery manifest (including customer list, expected items, etc.).

### 4.2 Real-Time Drive Monitoring

1. Delivery person’s live location is tracked.
2. The system monitors sales progress (items sold, payments, etc.).
3. Displays delivery completion percentage.

### 4.3 Drive Closure Process

1. Reconcile sales vs. returns.
2. Generate a financial summary (total sales, payments, etc.).
3. Update customer balances automatically.

### 4.4 Payment Collection Workflow

1. Delivery person scans customer QR or locates by phone/name.
2. Views outstanding balance.
3. Records payment amount and method.
4. Generates a digital receipt.
5. Sends receipt via SMS/Email.

### 4.5 QR Code Lifecycle

1. Generate QR codes (bulk or individual).
2. Print or display them for assignment.
3. Assign to customers upon registration.
4. Activate/deactivate as needed (lost/damaged QRs).
5. Replace if lost or damaged.

### 4.6 Route Planning & Map Integration

- Delivery person’s current location obtained via GPS.
- Customers sorted by distance or sequence.
- Route displayed on a map with directions.
- Option to skip or reorder customers based on real-time events.

---

## 5. React Native Implementation

1. **Offline Functionality**

   - Use Redux Persist or AsyncStorage for caching route and customer data.
   - Allow offline operations such as capturing sales/returns.
   - Sync data once the device reconnects.

2. **Location Tracking**

   - Use react-native-geolocation-service or react-native-background-geolocation for accurate, battery-optimized tracking.
   - Frequency and accuracy settings configurable per drive.

3. **Map & Directions**

   - Integrate with react-native-maps and Google Maps APIs for route visualization.
   - Optionally use Distance Matrix and Directions API for automated route optimization.

4. **QR Scanning**

   - Use react-native-camera or expo-barcode-scanner for QR code scanning.
   - Ensure offline scanning is possible; store data for later sync.

5. **Push Notifications & Alerts**

   - Use react-native-push-notification or FCM for new drive alerts, payment reminders, etc.

6. **Reporting & Exports**
   - Implement endpoints for fetching PDF/Excel data.
   - Present final output via share sheets or allow direct downloads on Admin side.

## 7. Additional Considerations

1. **Security**: Implement JWT or similar token-based authentication for all API calls.
2. **Scalability**: Allow for route optimization tools and advanced analytics as customer base grows.
3. **Data Backup**: Schedule regular database backups; consider a cloud-based solution for redundancy.
4. **Performance**: Optimize queries and usage of device resources (GPS, camera, local storage).

## API Implementation Notes

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:

   - All APIs should require authentication except login and password reset
   - Role-based access control should be implemented (admin vs. delivery person)
   - JWT or similar token-based auth recommended

2. **Response Format**:

   - Standardize on consistent JSON response format
   - Include metadata for pagination where applicable
   - Use appropriate HTTP status codes

3. **Performance Considerations**:

   - Implement caching where appropriate (e.g., routes, customer lists)
   - Optimize location tracking APIs for minimal battery usage
   - Use compression for larger datasets

4. **Mobile-Specific Optimizations**:

   - Minimize payload sizes for mobile data efficiency
   - Support partial responses and fields filtering
   - Implement proper error handling with meaningful messages

5. **Offline Support**:
   - Design APIs to support offline-first operations
   - Implement robust conflict resolution mechanisms
   - Use ETags or Last-Modified headers for efficient syncing

This API structure provides a comprehensive foundation for implementing the Milk Delivery Management System while ensuring scalability, efficiency, and maintainability.
